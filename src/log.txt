First I made the car stay in its lane by settitg constant d coordinate (line 252).
To solve jerk issues on edges of the path I applied splines (http://kluge.in-chemnitz.de/opensource/spline/) to smooth out the path
(lines ).
Next problems to solve are breaking acceleration limit at start and
hitting cars in front.
